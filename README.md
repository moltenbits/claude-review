# Code Review Skills for Claude Code

Based on [aidankinzett/claude-git-pr-skill#3](https://github.com/aidankinzett/claude-git-pr-skill/pull/3).

Claude Code skills for consistent, professional code reviews — both GitHub PRs and local code — using 5 specialized agents with P0-P3 severity scoring.

## What This Skill Does

This skill teaches Claude to:
- **Always use pending reviews** to batch comments (even under time pressure)
- **Create code suggestions** using the ```suggestion syntax
- **Choose the right event type** (COMMENT, APPROVE, or REQUEST_CHANGES)
- **Use correct `gh api` syntax** with proper quoting and flags

## Installation

### Option 1: Plugin Marketplace (Recommended)

Install directly from the marketplace using Claude Code:

```bash
# Add this marketplace
/plugin marketplace add aidankinzett/claude-git-pr-skill

# Install the plugin
/plugin install github-pr-review

# Verify installation
/plugin list
```

**For team-wide installation**, add to `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": [
    {
      "name": "github-pr-skills",
      "source": {
        "source": "github",
        "repo": "aidankinzett/claude-git-pr-skill"
      }
    }
  ],
  "plugins": {
    "github-pr-review": {
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

### Option 2: Manual Copy

Copy the skill directly to your skills directory:

```bash
# Personal (all projects)
cp -r github-pr-review/skills/github-pr-review ~/.claude/skills/

# Project-specific
cp -r github-pr-review/skills/github-pr-review .claude/skills/
```

## Usage

Once installed, Claude will automatically use this skill when you ask it to review pull requests. For example:

```
You: "Review PR #123 and suggest improvements"
Claude: *Uses github-pr-review skill to create pending review with batched comments*
```

## What Makes This Skill Different

**Without this skill**, Claude might:
- Post comments immediately without showing you first
- Skip pending reviews under time pressure
- Use incorrect `gh api` syntax
- Choose the wrong event type
- Post comments you didn't approve

**With this skill**, Claude will:
- ✅ **Show you exactly what will be posted** before posting
- ✅ **Ask for explicit approval** using yes/no questions
- ✅ Always create pending reviews first
- ✅ Batch all comments together
- ✅ Use code suggestions with ```suggestion blocks
- ✅ Choose appropriate event types (APPROVE for minor suggestions, REQUEST_CHANGES for blocking issues)
- ✅ Use correct syntax (single quotes around `comments[][]` parameters)

## Workflow Pattern

The skill enforces this workflow:

**1. Draft → 2. Show & Approve → 3. Post**

### Step 1: Draft Review
Claude analyzes the PR and prepares comments with code suggestions.

### Step 2: Show & Get Approval
Claude shows you EXACTLY what will be posted:
- Each comment with file and line number
- Code suggestions formatted
- Event type (APPROVE/REQUEST_CHANGES/COMMENT)
- Overall review message

You review and approve (or request changes).

### Step 3: Post Review (Technical)

After your approval, Claude posts using this pattern:

```bash
# Step 1: Create PENDING review with all comments
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/pulls/123/reviews \
  -X POST \
  -f commit_id="<SHA>" \
  -f 'comments[][path]=file.ts' \
  -F 'comments[][line]=42' \
  -f 'comments[][side]=RIGHT' \
  -f 'comments[][body]=Comment with ```suggestion block...' \
  --jq '{id, state}'

# Step 2: Submit when ready
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/pulls/123/reviews/<REVIEW_ID>/events \
  -X POST \
  -f event="APPROVE" \
  -f body="Overall review message"
```

## Benefits

- **Consistent workflow** across all PR reviews
- **Professional batched comments** instead of scattered notifications
- **Correct syntax** every time
- **Better decision making** on event types
- **Time-tested pattern** that works under pressure
